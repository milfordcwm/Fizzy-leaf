# Fizzy Leaf Sparkling Tea Website

A beautiful, static website for Fizzy Leaf Sparkling Tea using Formspark for contact form submissions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Formspark Integration

The contact form uses Formspark for handling form submissions without needing a server.

**Formspark is already configured!** ✅

The contact form is set up with Formspark and includes:
- Name field
- Email field
- Message field
- **Asynchronous submission** - no page refresh required!
- **Loading states** and **success/error feedback**

Form submissions are handled with JavaScript for a smooth user experience.

### 2. Logo Image

The website references `IMG_7455.png` for the logo. You'll need to:

2. Or update the `src` attribute in the hero section to point to your logo file

### 3. Google Maps API

The site uses Google Maps to show location information. The API key is already included in the code.
